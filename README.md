> Running R pre-commit hooks

## Overview

Pre-commit hooks are scripts that run automatically before a commit is
finalized in Git. Theyâ€™re used to catch issues early by enforcing checks
like code formatting, linting, or running tests before changes are
committed.

`captain` (hook) is a package that allows you to run git pre-commit
hooks in a R environment.

## Installation

The latest version can be installed from GitHub as follows:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("alexym1/captain")
```

## Usage

### Initialize pre-commit framework

``` r
captain::install_precommit()
```

### Run hooks

``` r
captain::run_precommit()
```

### Add hooks

Editing the `.pre-commit-config` file using
`captain::edit_precommit_config()`:

``` bash
repos:
  - repo: local
    hooks:
      - id: renv
        name: Synchronize project from renv.lock
        description: Synchronize the project from the renv.lock
        entry: Rscript inst/pre-commit/hooks/synchronize_project.R
        language: system
        pass_filenames: false
```
